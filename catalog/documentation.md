## Usage

Workloads GeoOps helps customers that do brick and mortar customer engagement connect all the tech that they use to deliver an experience to physical locations. That could look like the `New Relic Infrastructure` agents on their Point of Sale systems; but it necessarily has to also include the related `Services` in a cloud data center. We need to be able to qualitatively analyze the collection of services, computing devices, and even customer experiences (i.e. `Browser` or `Mobile` agents) that are delivering customer experiences as a location to answer the question, "how are my IT systems and services supporting the business in _that_ location."

This New Relic One Application allows customers to define Maps and then collect / assign Entities to points on those maps. Using the power of `Workloads` that collection of `Entities` can be managed by rules and tags so as to support the dynamic, ephemeral nature of modern IT infrastructure.
